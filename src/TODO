1. isValidMove
2. applyMove
3. checkGameOver
4. parseCommandLine to get move

5. (*) undoMove -- for alpha beta might need this function?

6. Implement sequentially (cpu) or in kernels first? Is the speedup measured comparing sequential on cpu vs parallel on gpu or gpu 1 thread vs gpu multiple threads?
