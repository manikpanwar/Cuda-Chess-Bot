The following are the compiling commands for the various iterations of the code. Our final iteration is #1 which is pvsplitOpenMpChess:

1. g++ -o pvsplitOpenMpChess chess.cpp pvsplitOpenMp.cpp -fopenmp -O3 -m64
2. g++ -o alphabetaChess chess.cpp alphabeta.cpp -O3 -m64
3. g++ -o minimaxPthreadChess chess.cpp minimaxPthreads.cpp -lpthread
4. g++ -o pthreadChess chess.cpp pvsplitPthreads.cpp -lpthread


To change AI depth, modify MAXDEPTH in alphabeta.h | default : 7

To change openMP number of threads, modify NUMOFTHREADS in chess.h | default : 16

If you want to run any of the 2, 3 or 4 compile commands (comment out #define OMP from chess.h)
